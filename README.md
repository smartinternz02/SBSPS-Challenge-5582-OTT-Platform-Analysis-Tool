## _The OTT Platform Analysis_
## Problem Statement
In 2019, the OTT market was valued at 85.16 Billion USD and it is expected to reach 194.20 Billion USD by 2025. Under COVID-19, many countries introduced social distancing measures that forced theaters to limit the number of audiences or even shut down and that encouraged people to stay at home, accelerating the increase in OTT platform subscriptions. Therefore, it is the right time to analyze different OTT platforms and provide useful information for people who are not able to decide which platform fits them best.

## Observations
In today's generation where OTT platforms are reaching new peaks, setting milestones, engaing a completely new audience with content never created before and different set of subscription fees it is more difficult than ever to simply select which OTT platform(s) should one go with and when.

This is where we come to the rescue by giving a simple interface to the user consisting of a dashboard that is there to analyze with the help of IBM Cognos Analytics,so in a brief manner we ultimately aim to provide the user with the subscription(s) he/she should go with based on user's taste in genre, content apetite, language prefernces and other vital factors one should be considerate about.
